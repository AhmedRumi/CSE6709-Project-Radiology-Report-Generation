# CSE6709-Project-Radiology-Report-Generation

A significant application of natural language generation in the medical field involves developing support systems that can analyze patient X-ray images and generate draft reports summarizing the clinical findings. These systems can accelerate radiology reporting workflows while reducing workload and minimizing errors. However, challenges persist, including capturing complex medical semantics and ensuring the clinical accuracy of the generated reports. In this context, this project makes the following contributions to addressing this critical task.

In this project, we introduce a prompt augmentation technique that generates preliminary findings to enhance the performance of state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we generate synthetic chest X-ray images using various GAN architectures and compare their performance. Furthermore, we fine-tune a model that combines the VIT-L vision encoder with the Llama-7B LLM and evaluate its overall performance.
